# Viewing and Creating Boards
Boards can be viewed on the Boards page. The user’s boards are listed under “My Boards” while boards from teams that the user is a member of are listed under “Team Boards”:

New boards be created by clicking on the “Create New Board” button. The user is brought to the New Board page, where they can fill out the board’s necessary information:

The user can select the default column style, which consists of the columns “Went Well”, “To Improve”, and “Actions”. Otherwise, they can select “Custom”, allowing them to add, edit, and delete columns to be added to the board:

The user can also add the board to a specific team, selecting from the “Team” dropdown menu that is populated with the teams they are a member of. The form defaults to none.
After the user fills out all required fields and clicks on the “Add Board” button, the new board is added to the collection and they are brought back to their Boards page.
From the Boards page, a board can be viewed by clicking on its respective “View” button. This brings the user to the individual board’s page. A user can also access the board from its URL, but will need to be signed in to interact with it.
