# Inviting and Removing Team Members

The owner of a team can invite members by clicking on the “Invite” button located at the bottom of the page. This brings up a text field where they can add an email to send the invitation to:

After entering an email and clicking “Send”, the new member is added to the team:
![New member added](https://github.com/sarantharma/GyroscopicProject/blob/passport/User%20Guides/img/new_member.png)

This also sends an invitation email to the invitee’s email using a dynamic Sendgrid template, including a link to the team’s page:

The team owner can also remove members from the team by clicking their respective “Remove” buttons:
