# Adding a Board to a Team

Board owners can add their board to teams they are a member of, both when creating or editing the board.

When creating a board, a user can select the desired team from the dropdown menu at the bottom of the form:
![Add new board to team](https://github.com/sarantharma/GyroscopicProject/blob/passport/User%20Guides/img/add_board_team_new.png)

This can also be done by editing a board from its page:
![Add board to team from edit](https://github.com/sarantharma/GyroscopicProject/blob/passport/User%20Guides/img/add_board_team_edit.png)

Afterward, the board is linked to the team and is visible on the team's page:
