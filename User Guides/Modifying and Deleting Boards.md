# Modifying and Deleting Boards

Boards can be modified on their page by both the board’s owner as well as the owner of the team that the board is in (if any).

These users can click the “Edit” button to be brought to the Edit Board page to make changes to the name and description of the board, as well as the team that it belongs to:

They can also add a column by clicking the “Add Column” button, which then brings up a text field for the column name and an “Add” button. After entering the name and clicking the button, the column is added to the end of the board:

They can also delete a column by clicking on the 'x' on the top right of each column:

The board’s owner can also delete the board by clicking the “Delete” button, removing it from the collection:
