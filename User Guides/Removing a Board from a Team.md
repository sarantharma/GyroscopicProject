# Removing a Board from a Team

The owner of a team can remove boards from their team by clicking its "Remove" button on the team page:

This can also be done by both the team owner and the board owner in the "Edit Board" page of the board, changing the board's team in the dropdown menu:

In both of these cases, the board is removed from the team but remains in the board owner's account. Instructions for deleting a board entirely can be found [here](https://github.com/sarantharma/GyroscopicProject/blob/passport/User%20Guides/Modifying%20and%20Deleting%20Boards.md)
