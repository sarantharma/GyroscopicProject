# Board Interactions
## Posting, deleting, moving, editing, and voting on board comments

Boards can be interacted with on their page. Users can comment on its columns, both under their username or anonymously. 
They can also drag comments from one column to another, and give them an upvote or downvote. The user is also able to delete their comments using the ‘x’ located at the top right of the comment, or double click the comment to edit it.
All of this is done in real time.
